Understanding Web Testing: SAST vs. DAST

Web testing in cybersecurity involves identifying vulnerabilities in web applications. The two primary methods are:

1.      SAST (Static Application Security Testing) – A white-box testing method that analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries before execution to find security flaws.

2.      DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) – A black-box testing method that tests a running application in real-time to detect vulnerabilities during execution.

Recruiting Questions for SAST and DAST Testers

General Web Security Testing Questions:

1.      Can you explain the differences between SAST and DAST? When would you use each?

2.      What are the most common web security vulnerabilities you have encountered?

3.      Which security frameworks or standards do you follow (e.g., OWASP Top 10, NIST, ISO 27001)?

4.      How do you stay updated on the latest cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities?

5.      Have you worked with DevSecOps? How do you integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines?

SAST-Specific Questions:

6.      Which SAST tools have you worked with (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode)?

7.      How do you handle false positives in SAST reports?

8.      What programming languages are you most comfortable analyzing for security vulnerabilities?

9.      Can you walk me through a time you identified a major security flaw using SAST?

10.  How would you improve the accuracy and efficiency of static analysis in a large development team?

DAST-Specific Questions:

11.  Which DAST tools have you used (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Acunetix, AppScan)?

12.  How do you test for SQL injection, XSS, and other OWASP vulnerabilities dynamically?

13.  Can you describe your approach to penetration testing within a DAST framework?

14.  How do you ensure DAST testing does not disrupt production environments?

15.  Have you performed authenticated scans using DAST? What challenges did you face?
